## Phase 1: Twintania

### Key Mechanics

{: .everyone }
> Look out for {% glossary Twister %} cast, you will need to be moving when it finishes otherwise you will die and kill anyone near you. Start moving at 90% and spread out to make sure you have somewhere safe to run.
>
> {% glossary Fireball %} will target a player with a party stack, Generate more LB by having one player stay out of the first {% glossary Fireball %} stack at the start of this phase.

{: .tanks }
> {% glossary Death Sentence %} is a forced tank swap. Communicate an order with your Co-tank.
>
> Your role is to position the boss in a way to drop a {% glossary Neurolink %} on each of the 1,2,3 markers in order. This will happen when the boss hits 74%, 44% and 0%. You should be on the outside of the boss towards the wall unless moving in to stack with party for other mechanics.
>
> <img src="./assets/images/ucobmarkers.png" alt="UCOB Markers" style="height: 300px">

{: .damage }
> You will have two roles in this phase, firstly **Ranged** will need to bait {% glossary Liquid Hell %} by being the furthest player from the boss through the phase. Assign a **Primary Baiter** and **Backup Baiter**.
>
> All DPS can get targetted by {% glossary Hatch %} orbs, run to a {% glossary Neurolink %} and make sure you are in the {% glossary Neurolink %} when the {% glossary Hatch %} orb reaches you. 
>
> If you are **Primary Baiter** and you get hatch, make sure the other baiter is aware they need to take {% glossary Liquid Hell %}.

{: .healers }
> Just stay outta the way lol.

</details>

## Phase 2: Nael

### Key Mechanics

{: .everyone }
> {% glossary Thunderstruck %} Two players are targeted with the {% glossary Thunderstruck %} debuff and need to stay away from the party to avoid killing party members or giving them paralysis.
> 
> {% glossary Wings of Salvation %} Large white puddles appear on the ground exploding shortly after, lethal damage if you are in the puddle when it explodes. It leaves behind a small white puddle after the explosion which can remove doom.
> 
> {% glossary Doom %} Inflicted to multiple players, will kill the player when the timer reaches zero. You can remove this by stepping in the light-puddle left behind by Wings of Salvation.

{: .tanks }
> {% glossary Dalamud Dive %} Nael jumps onto her target, dealing significant splash damage. Make sure to spread away from the tank to prevent any extra damage.
> 
> {% glossary Bahamuts Claw %} Physical tankbuster consisting of 5 successive hits to her target.
> 
> Nael enters with {% glossary Dalamud Dive %} on **Tank with last aggro on Twintania**, followed by {% glossary Bahamuts Claw %}. Use an Invuln here and keep this away from party.

### Icebitten and Firescorched

Through the phase, dragons will attack players with iceballs and AOE other players with a fire tether, each applies a debuff or removes the opposite debuff. If you have either debuff and you are hit by the same effect again (ie: hit by fireball and you already have firescorched <img src="./assets/images/icons/firescorched.png" class="bufficon">) you will die.

To safely manage this, you will stack together for Fire tethers, to remove the ice debuffs from the party. There will be **FOUR** fire tethers during the phase and they should be stacked or taken out of the group using the following order;

**IN > OUT > IN > IN**

This means the first tether is stacked, the second tether is taken out of the party, and the third and fourth fire tether are also stacked with the party. It is each members responsibility to monitor their debuffs and ensure they are in the fire stacks in time.

The second fire tether is usually taken out to the LEFT of the party stack location.
<img src="./assets/images/ucobfire2.png" alt="UCOB Markers" style="height: 300px">

{: .important }
Whoever gets the second fire tether and takes it out of the party must AVOID the third fire tether as they will already have the fire debuff and this will kill them if they join the stack.

### Quotes

Through the phase Nael will say various quotes, these are indicators for upcoming mechanics, if you cannot translate the quotes then you will die to the mechanics. Each quote translates to a pair of mechanics in this phase. 

- O hallowed moon, take fire and scorch my foes! = {% glossary Lunar Dynamo %} → {% glossary Thermionic Beam %}
- O hallowed moon, shine you the iron path! = {% glossary Lunar Dynamo %} → {% glossary Iron Chariot %}
- Blazing path, lead me to iron rule! = {% glossary Thermionic Beam %} → {% glossary Iron Chariot %}
- Take fire, O hallowed moon! = {% glossary Thermionic Beam %} → {% glossary Lunar Dynamo %}
- From on high I descend, the iron path to call! or From on high I descend, the iron path to walk! = {% glossary Raven's Dive %} → {% glossary Iron Chariot %}
- From on high I descend, the hallowed moon to call! = {% glossary Raven's Dive %} → {% glossary Lunar Dynamo %}
- Fleeting light! 'Neath the red moon, scorch you the earth! = {% glossary Dalamud Dive %} → {% glossary Thermionic Beam %}
- Fleeting light! Amid a rain of stars, exalt you the red moon! = {% glossary Meteor Stream %} → {% glossary Dalamud Dive %}

Quotes come in pairs, either one of the two can happen and you need to be able to read the quote to identify them. It is easier to remember them when you break them down to pairs of two possible mechanics.

Quote 1:
- IN → STACK
- IN → SPREAD

Quote 2:
- STACK → IN
- STACK → OUT

Quote 3: 
- SPREAD → IN
- SPREAD → OUT

QUOTE 4:
- TANKBUSTER DIVE → STACK
- SPREAD → TANKBUSTER DIVE

*Don't tell yoshi-p but there are some good tools to help quickly translate quotes to more understandable mechanics...*

### Phase Overview

The fight starts and a pillar will drop in the room, spread out for Meteor Stream and dodge the cleaves.

Boss will enter on a tank and the party will stack up behind the boss ready for the first quotes. Two players will get {% glossary Thunderstruck %}.

Quotes 1: 
- O hallowed moon, take fire and scorch my foes! (IN → STACK)
- O hallowed moon, shine you the iron path! (IN → SPREAD)

The two players with {% glossary Thunderstruck %} must seperate from the party and take up a position near the boss opposite the party. Thunderstruck will resolve before the second mechanic in the quote.
