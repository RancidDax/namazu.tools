# Namazu.tools

Namazu tools is a community driven project to collate the various guides and tools created for raiding in the FF14 Materia Datacenter.

The goal is to create a comprehensive tool with all guides for current Ultimate and Savage content in one consistent open-source website.

## How to Contribute
Make a **Fork** of the project and do your edits in the fork, you can then create a **Pull Request** to merge your edits back into the main repository.

## Pages
Each page is a single Markdown File (.md) which can be located anywhere in the root folder. Each page begins with a header to specify the page name and details, this will not appear in the final page.

After this, you can use Markdown or HTML formatting to build out the page. Take a look at some of the [existing pages](https://github.com/The-Seat-of-Namazu/namazu.tools/blob/main/top.md?plain=1) for an example. 

[Here is some reference guides for the different types of formatting you can use:

This website uses Just-The-Docs, a website generating Jekyll theme that can create special custom components using simple tags inside the page. You can read more about how these work with the link below.
[Just-The-Docs Documentation](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/ui-components)

## Glossary
A custom glossary add-in allows creating mouse-over tooltips that can be inserted into documents. These must be pre-defined in the ./_data/glossary.yml file.

```yml
- term: Thunderstruck
  definition: Two players are targeted with the Thunderstruck debuff and need to stay away from the party to avoid killing party members or giving them paralysis.
```

Once definded, these can be inserted into the page using the following tag.

```
{% glossary <term> %}
```
for example...
```
{% glossary Thunderstruck %}
```

Which will create a tooltip like so...
