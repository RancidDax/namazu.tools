## Phase 1: Omega

{: .tanks }
> It is very important in this phase to keep Omega in the center of the arena.

The phase begins with heavy hitting auto-attacks before starting the first mechanic:

### Program Loop

Program loop begins with each player being assigned a number from 1 to 4, with two of each across the party. This mechanic requires 4 sets of 2 towers to be soaked in a sequential order **(<img src="./assets/images/icons/first-in-line.png" class="bufficon"> → <img src="./assets/images/icons/second-in-line.png" class="bufficon"> → <img src="./assets/images/icons/third-in-line.png" class="bufficon"> → <img src="./assets/images/icons/fourth-in-line.png" class="bufficon">)** that will deal significant damage to the player inside. 

For each set of towers that needs to be soaked, two tethers must be taken by two players and taken away from the towers in the order **(<img src="./assets/images/icons/third-in-line.png" class="bufficon"> → <img src="./assets/images/icons/fourth-in-line.png" class="bufficon"> → <img src="./assets/images/icons/first-in-line.png" class="bufficon"> → <img src="./assets/images/icons/second-in-line.png" class="bufficon">)**.

These tethers will explode in a large AOE on the targeted player and inflict a HP penalty debuff which will wear off after 10 seconds. 

{: .healers }
> The 3 and 4 players will have their HP penalty falling off as they need to soak their towers, so a priority system between the healers is used to heal both players.

{: .tanks }
> Personal mitigations can be used to help heal up the 3 and 4 players.

As this mechanic can become messy with players grabbing tethers from others and taking different towers, a priority system is used to facilitate the movement of players. The priority used by MUR PF is seen in the cheatsheet.

### Pantokrator

{: .healers }
> Pantokrator has a lot of damage going out from the stacks and spreads, and requires heavy mitigation before spreading into your light parties.

Pantokrator begins and assigns each player with a number from 1 to 4 again, indicating the order that Omega will drop a small AOE on players. Omega will then cast **flamethrower** and cleave two pizza slices of the arena on a random opposite cardinals/intercardinals. 

Players will need to **split into groups of 4**, with each group containing only one of each number from 1 - 4. This is done by the priority system used in program loop, with higher priority players moving to the SW party and lower priority players moving to the NE party. 

If Omega cleaves the NE and SW waymarkers first then each party rotates to the safespot clockwise of their original position. **(image here)**

The cleaves will then either rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise. As the cleaves rotate each player will also leave behind puddles. The party stacks together at the rear cleave to take a **3 player line-stack**, whilst the numbers leave to take their AOE away from the group before joining back to the party. This process repeats until each number has taken their AOE and the cleaves cease.

{: .warning }
> It is very easy for the puddles to get out of hand, so stack as tightly as possible and move along the edge of Omega's hitbox whilst moving as a group. 
>
> Players whose turn it is to leave the stack should wait for a puddle to drop under their feet before exiting the stack. Using **sprint** can help but isn't required.

Omega will then cast two tank buster cleaves on the two furthest players, and 6 line AOEs on the non-tanks. Both tanks **stack north, outside of the hitbox** and use invulnerability, and the party spreads within Omegas hitbox as seen in the cheatsheet.

After this Omega will cast it's enrage: **Atomic Ray**.

## Phase 2: Omega-M & F

{: .tanks }
> Rampart can be cast as Omega "jumps", allowing a usage during the opening tank buster and in Limitless Synergy.

Phase 2 begins and Omega-M and Omega-F will spawn. 

{: .damage }
> There is about a 2 GCD window once both bosses become targetable where they are susceptible to cleave damage and this should be abused as much as possible. 
> 
> 2 minute raid buffs should be used either before they are targetable or on the 1st GCD.

Omega-M and F will then cast **Firewall**, targeting the 4 closest players to each boss. If a player is close to M they will be inflicted with **Packet Filter F** and be unable to damage Omega-F. If a player is close to F the opposite happens. 

The party will split up into light parties for this so each boss will have a healer, tank, and two DPS able to damage it.

Both bosses will then tank buster the player with highest emnity to them, followed by 3 auto-attacks.

Omega-M and Omega-F will then cast:

### Party Synergy

Both bosses will become untargetable and disappear as the mechanic begins. 

The party is inflicted with either **Mid Glitch** <img src="./assets/images/icons/mid-glitch.png" class="bufficon">  or **Remote Glitch** <img src="./assets/images/icons/remote-glitch.png" class="bufficon">. Each player is also assigned 1 of 4 coloured symbols above their head, with two of each. 

{: .everyone }
> The party should line-up from East to West as seen in the cheatsheet. 
> 
> The furthest West symbol of a pair will be designated as Light Party 1, whilst the furthest East will be designated Light Party 2.

At the same time, **Omega's Eye** will spawn on a random cardinal/intercardinal. **This will be designated as relative north**.

Clones will then spawn around the center of the arena, 2 Omega-M, and 2 Omega-F. An Omega-M and Omega-F pair will always be facing eachother and should be focused on. These two clones will perform a set of AOEs that are dependant on the weapons they are holding.

The possible combinations are:

| Female | Male   |
|:-------|:------ |
| Staff  | Shield |
| Staff  | Sword  |
| Skates | Shield |
| Skates | Sword  |

[![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/862721895962902589/1108336788021444689/p2_dodges.png)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/862721895962902589/1108336788021444689/p2_dodges.png)

{: .note }
> The "cursed" pattern (F-Staff & M-Shield) can be easily resolved by using the far edges of the waymarks eitherside of the male.
> 
> These waymarks also help to position during Mid/Remote Glitch.

Once the dodge is made, all players must resolve their Mid/Remote Glitch by splitting into the previously designated light parties and moving to the West (LP1) and East (LP2) **relative to Omega's Eye**. 

After each player takes an AOE, two stacks will then appear on two random players. Multiple clones will spawn around the arena, including a line of 3 Males, and 1 Female in the center. Using the **middle of the 3 males as relative north**, the party must form two stacks in their designated light parties around the female to get pushed back to 1 of 3 safe spots.

Light Party 1 will always anchor West, and Light Party 2 will either be pushed South for Mid Glitch, or East for Remote Glitch.

If the stack players are part of the **same light party** the north most stack relative to the eye must swap positions with their partner. **(video)**

{: .tanks }
> Between the start of the phase and after party synergy Omega-M has changed to Omega-F and vice versa, meaning you will both have to re-provoke your boss.

{: .everyone }
> The party should pre-position at South-South-West for the upcoming mechanic.

After ~5 auto-attacks from each boss, both Omega-M and Omega-F will cast:

### Limitless Synergy

{: .everyone }
> The party should pre-position at South-South-West for this mechanic.

{: .damage }
> As the Limitless Synergy cast finishes the Packet Filter debuff will disappear, allowing about 1/2 GCDs of cleave damage.

Omega-F will become invulnerable, forcing the party to attack the Male. Two tethers will spawn on two random players, orginating from two Omega clones. Both tanks will grab their designated tether (as seen in the cheatsheet).

At the same time, a Male clone will spawn on a random cardinal/intercardinal and cast **Optimized Sagitarrius Arrow** on a random player. This AOE will bait across the hitbox but leave a safe spot within it, which the non-tanks will move into.

{: .tanks }
> Once the AOE is baited, both tanks take their tether to the wall close to their clone and rotate clock wise on the edge of the arena. Heavy personal mitigation is required to survive this tank buster.
>
> While you are taking your tank buster you should also find where the **shield male** is.

Once the tank busters resolve, everyone but the tanks should **stack under Omega-M** as 3 flare markers will appear on 3 random players. These can be ignored. The Male clone with a shield that is on the edge of the arena will then cast **Beyond Defense** which will be baited by both tanks.

The tank that was not hit joins the stack, and the tank that was hit should then move away from the Male so that the stack is closest to the Male's new position as it will then cast **Pile Pitch**.

{: .everyone }
>This strategy requires **HEAVY** mitigation to survive, as not only are you stacking all the flares, you are also taking a stack and then a heavy hitting raidwide immediately after. 
>
>To cover both sets of hits, you can cast your mitigation at around 4/5 pulses of the flares.

Throughout this whole mechanic Omega F has been casting her enrage **Laser Shower**. Once Omega-M is defeated, Omega-F becomes targetable. 

Upon defeating Omega-F, the transition begins:

### Phase 2 -> Phase 3 Transition

{: .everyone }
>The party should line-up from East to West as seen in the cheatsheet before debuffs are assigned. 

{: .healers }
> To survive this transition the party must have *at least* a barrier healer's shield covering the hits.

The debuffs assigned will target 4 players with **Sniper Cannon Fodder** (spread) <img src="./assets/images/icons/sniper.png" class="bufficon">, 2 players with **High-powered Sniper Cannon Fodder** (stack) <img src="./assets/images/icons/high-power-sniper.png" class="bufficon"> and 2 players will not be assigned a debuff.

Players must spread according to their debuff and priority, with the stacks and non-debuff players along the south edge of the arena, and the spread players along the north edge.

Two sets of **Arms** will appear that will cause large circular AOEs, as well as a cascading donut AOE (Wave Repeater) originating from the center. To resolve this, players will dodge Wave Repeater by moving in and out from the edge of the arena, and then dodging into the first arm explosion where they will take their spread or stack. **video**

{: .note }
> Using **sprint** can help make the 2->1 dodge easier, but isn't required.

## Phase 3: Reconfigured Omega

{: .tanks }
> There are hard hitting auto-attacks throughout this entire phase. The OT should be using their targeted mitigation on the MT as much as possible to help reduce the strain on the healers.

{: .healers }
> This phase requires high mitigation for each **Latent Defect**. Use the mitigation sheet provided, and allow the shield healer to get dead center of the arena to mitigate damage before each **Latent Defect**.

The phase begins with a hard-hitting raid wide cast:

### Hello World

This mechanic assigns **a lot** of debuffs to players. Thankfully, most of them can be ignored as they will resolve themselves simply by doing the mechanic and are only present as fail conditions for doing it *incorrectly*.

For those interested I've attached the ignorable debuffs in the dropdown below:

<details markdown=1>
<summary>Hello World Debuffs</summary>

**Cascading Latent Defect** <img src="./assets/images/icons/latent cascade.png" class="bufficon">
> Received from soaking a red puddle. Cleansed by allowing **Critical Underflow Bug** to expire. Failing to do so will wipe the raid.

**Latent Performance Defect** <img src="./assets/images/icons/latent performance defect.png" class="bufficon">
> Received from soaking a blue puddle. Cleansed by allowing **Critical Performance Bug** to expire. Failing to do so will wipe the raid.

**Latent Defect** <img src="./assets/images/icons/latent defect.png" class="bufficon">
> Players must take damage before the debuff expires or they will die. This is assigned to **Christmas Tether** players.

**Latent Synchronization Bug** <img src="./assets/images/icons/latent synch.png" class="bufficon">
> Must be hit by **Critical Synchronization Bug** to remove. Failure to do so results in death.

</details>

However, to actually resolve the mechanic we only care about 5 of them:

- **Critical Underflow Bug** (aka Red Rot) <img src="./assets/images/icons/Red Rot.webp" class="bufficon">
- **Critical Performance Bug** (aka Blue Rot) <img src="./assets/images/icons/Blue Rot.png" class="bufficon">
- **Critical Overflow Bug** (aka Defamation) <img src="./assets/images/icons/Defamation.webp" class="bufficon">
- **Critical Synchronization Bug** (aka Stack) <img src="./assets/images/icons/Stack (HW).webp" class="bufficon">
- **Local Code Smell/Local Regression** (aka Christmas Tether) <img src="./assets/images/icons/local regression.png" class="bufficon">
- **Remote Code Smell/Remote Regression** (aka Blue Tether) <img src="./assets/images/icons/remote regression.png" class="bufficon">

Throughout the phase, each player will have to get each of these debuffs. Once you have received and resolved your debuff, you will become immune to getting it again.

Upon casting **Latent Defect**, 2 red and 2 blue puddles spawn on opposite sides of the arena. The corresponding coloured rot players will have to soak these puddles. As rot passes on contact, these players should be extremely cautious getting to their positions

**Critical Overflow Bug** and **Critical Synchronization Bug** are assigned randomly to one colour of rot. This will persist through the rest of the mechanic such that if red is defamation to begin with, red will be defamation for the remainder of the mechanic.

**Stack rots** should be as close to eachother as they can while still resolving their blue puddle, and **defamation rots** should be on the far edges of their puddles.

{: .note }
> MUR has the stack rot players move inside the boss' hitbox, whilst the defamation players move outside the hitbox.
>
> Tether players should also give way to rots to reduce car crashes. 
> 
> All players should never pass through the direct center of the arena to avoid walking through the H2 player.

Tethers players will initially have an "inactive" buff, meaning that they can be any distance away from eachother without causing it to break. Once their tether becomes active, if **Blue Tethers** move far apart, the tether will break, and if **Christmas Tethers** move close together, their tether will break. Both breaks cause **high raid-wide** "patch" damage and a **Thrice-come Ruin debuff** <img src="./assets/images/icons/Thrice come Ruin.webp" class="bufficon"> to be inflicted on each player.

Failing to break a tether before it expires results in a wipe.

The **Blue Tether** players will move to the stack rots and in between the puddles, each player stacking close to a rot player. After the stack hits, the **Blue Tether** players can move out to give themself rot by stacking **on top** of the rot player, forcing the tether to break in the process.

{: .warning }
> Popping the **Blue Tether** *too* early can cause wipes as the initial hits from defamation and the stack give a magic vulnerability debuff for 1 second.

The **Christmas Tether** players will be standing outside the puddle next to the defamation players, and giving themself rot once the defamation AOE occurs. They will then break their tether by **getting close to one another**, being careful not to do it too soon after the first tether break as it will wipe the raid due to **Thrice-come Ruin**.

This mechanic repeats **Latent Defect** a total of 4 times, where for the final **Latent Defect** all players (except defamation) will move to the **stack rot** side. This will cause the **Christmas Tether** to break immediately, and then the **Blue Tether** will be broken manually after.

After rots expire Omega will cast another hard hitting raid wide **Critical Error**, before starting the next mechanic:

## Monitors

{: .everyone }
> The party should pre-position in the cheatsheet lineup for monitors to quickly find their spots.

After ~3 more auto-attacks, Omega will begin to cast **Oversampled Wave Cannon** and point a set of blue monitors either true East or true West. 

3 random players will also be inflicted with **Oversampled Wave Cannon Loading**, putting the same East/West facing monitors on their person. Players must position and align themselves such that **each monitor** is only hitting **2 people** at a time, as seen in the MUR cheatsheet. If hit by a monitor, a large AOE will explode on the player for high damage and they will be inflicted by **Twice-come Ruin**.

Misaligning your monitor will result in players either: not being hit by monitor, or hit by 2+ monitors which will result in **doom** being inflicted.

{: .note }
> The monitor positions "lock-in" as the **Oversampled Wave Cannon** cast **finishes**, allowing monitor players to greed GCDs. 

If solved correctly, Omega will cast it's enrage: **Ion Efflux**.

## Phase 4: Blue Screen

{: .damage }
> Depending on team comp or damage needs, DPS LB3 can be sent at the end of P3 or at the start of P4. Sending in P4 requires 2 mins to be used during **monitors**.

This phase is fairly straight forward, with each player taking a protean and then taking two stacks south of the boss. This set of mechanics repeats 3 times. Just before the 2nd proteans, the party must step in to avoid **Wave Repeater**. Similiarly, after the 3rd stack the party must wait, and then step in to avoid another **Wave Repeater**.

If two stacks appear on one side of the boss, the southmost stack adjusts to the other side, and the opposite side's mDPS flexes.

Omega must be below 20% health before it's enrage is cast: **Blue Screen**.

## Phase 5: Dynamis M & F - (Run: Dynamis)

{: .everyone }
> Each Run: Dynamis cast comes with a **HEAVY** raid-wide hit that should be appropriately mitigated by every class.

This phase is very mechanically heavy, having 3 trios and lasting approximately 5 minutes.

Each trio is split into a "mechanic" section and a "Hello World" section. During the Hello World sections, two players are assigned the debuffs:

**Hello, Distant World**
 > Causes a large AOE on the player, inflicting them with 1 stack of **Spark of Hope**. The AOE will then "bounce" to the **furthest player** away causing a smaller AOE and inflicting that player with 1 stack of **Spark of Hope**. The AOE will bounce once more to the **furthest player** away, causing the same small AOE and inflicting the player with 1 stack of **Spark of Hope**

**Hello, Near World**
 > Causes a large AOE on the player, inflicting them with 1 stack of **Spark of Hope**. The AOE will then "bounce" to the **closest player** to them, causing a smaller AOE and inflicting that player with 1 stack of **Spark of Hope**. The AOE will bounce once more to the **closest player** again, causing the same small AOE and inflicting the player with 1 stack of **Spark of Hope**

The goal of the entirety of phase 5 is to end the phase with three stacks of **Spark of Hope** on every player, as this is required to complete phase 6.

After Omega-M becomes targetable, he will immediately cast a tank buster on the player with the highest emnity. This should be tank swapped. 

{: .note } 
> Party member's 15 second mitigations can be used at the 2nd tank buster hit, allowing it to be up for the future trios.  

After 2 auto-attacks, Omega-M will then cast: 

### Run: Dynamis (Delta Version)
I highly recommend looking at the toolbox for this trio as well as reading this guide, as this is a very intensive mechanic that becomes hard to digest through entirely text alone.

{: .healers}
> This is a very hard hitting mechanic and it becomes difficult to heal due to tethers. When able, healers should be given priority for inner tethers and after the initial monitor hit, players should squeeze in for healing.

Omega-M will become untargetable and disappear, **Beetle Omega** and **Final Omega** will then spawn randomly on the East/West cardinals, and **Omega's Eye** will spawn at North. Each player will then be inflicted with **Local Code Smell** and **Remote Code Smell**, such that there will be **2 Blue Tethers** and **2 Christmas Tethers**.

Two **Blue Tether Players** will also receive **Hello, Distant World** and **Hello, Near World**.

**Blues Tethers** will then go to **Beetle Omega**, and **Christmas Tethers** to **Final Omega**. Both pairs of tethers will line up parallel to the edge of the arena on their side, such that there is a tether closer to the center of the arena (**Inner Tether**), and a tether closer to the edge of the arena (**Outer Tether**). 

[![](https://github.com/RancidDax/namazu.tools/assets/104756079/1d95a258-2f1d-4b07-9c57-42f650ce9b60)](https://github.com/RancidDax/namazu.tools/assets/104756079/1d95a258-2f1d-4b07-9c57-42f650ce9b60)

Much like phase 3, breaking tethers results in a **large raid-wide hit** as well as inflicting **Thrice-come Ruin** on the party. However if the tether debuffs expire the party is killed. As such, we want to gradually break all 4 throughout the course of the mechanic so that the damage does not kill the party whilst not letting the tethers expire.

As the tethers are still **inactive**, the **Outer Blue Tether** will stretch so that it will break immediately upon becoming active.

Around 9 seconds before the tethers activate a blue or yellow **Rocket Punch** add will spawn on each player of the party and will jump on them after a period of time, wiping the raid. 

 **Rocket Punch** must be "mitigated" by having two of opposite colours landing on eachother. Both pairs of **Christmas Tethers** will stack on eachother, whilst the **Outer Blue Tethers** will wait for their tether to activate (and break) before quickly moving to stack on the **Inner Blue Tether Players**. If two players have the same colour **Rocket Punch**, the **Inner Tethers** simply **swap places with the player they are tethered to**.

Around 4 seconds before the tethers activate, 6 **Arms** with spinning arrows will appear on each intercardinal and N/S around the arena. These Arms will attack the closest person to them with a wide line AOE that will rotate in the direction of the arrows.

To resolve this, 1 player must move to each of the 6 **Arms** and bait the AOE on the side that forces it to cleave outside of the arena rather than directly through it. The **Outer Blue Tethers** are responsible for baiting the intercardinal Arms on their side, whilst the **Christmas Tether Players** will bait both their intercardinal Arms (**Outer Christmas**) and the N/S Arms (**Inner Christmas**).

Upon baiting the **Rocket Punch** AOE, **Omega's Eye** will cleave the center of the arena, and players who are responsible for baiting an Arm will move to do so. **Final Omega** will then begin to cast **Monitor** at North or South, as well as inflicting a random **Blue Tether Player** with **Oversampled Wave Cannon Loading**. 

At the same time, **Inner Blue Tethers** break their tether as they move to the center to bait **Beyond Defense** from an Omega-M that has spawned. The player that is hit by **Beyond Defense** must move either East or West so they are not caught by the subsequent **Pile Pitch**, being careful not to be cleaved by **Final Omega's Monitor**. 

After baiting their Arms, **Outer Blue Tethers** will go to the middle to stack on the player who was not hit by **Beyond Defense**, standing on the side that is not being cleaved by **Final Omega's Monitor**. The player who was inflicted with **Oversampled Wave Cannon Loading** must face the monitor to the opposite side of the arena that **Final Omega** is cleaving, so that both sets of monitors are only hitting **2 Christmas Players** each.

{: .note} 
> **Sprint** is extremely helpful in this mechanic. It's safe for everyone **except Outer Blue Tether Players** to pop sprint when the tethers activate.
> 
> The **Outer Blue Tether Players** should use theirs after baiting the AOE from their Arm to comfortably get to middle for **Pile Pitch**.

After the Monitors resolve, **Beetle Omega** will cleave one side of the arena with a 60% angled cleave. The **Non-debuff Blue Tether Players** will move to the side opposite of **Beetle Omega**. The **Outer Christmas Tethers** will rotate so that the player that is currently within the cleave ends up under Omega, and the **Inner Christmas Tether** will then break their tether as everyone else lines up for **Hello World** as seen below:

[![](https://github.com/RancidDax/namazu.tools/assets/104756079/0a1c5576-830f-4ea1-8d00-5d12a23f06e4)](https://github.com/RancidDax/namazu.tools/assets/104756079/0a1c5576-830f-4ea1-8d00-5d12a23f06e4)
##### Image by Bird

{: .warning}
> **Christmas Tether** breaks must be done at the right time. Due to **Twice-come Ruin** debuffs from **Monitors** and **Pile Pitch**, the first break must be delayed. However, the first **Christmas Tether Players** can use the tether timer and break their tether at 15s as it will always be safe.
>
> Similarly, the second **Christmas Tether** break can be done at ~2 seconds.

{: .note }
> If solved correctly, 6 players will have 1 stack of **Spark of Hope**.

Omega-M will then do another tank buster which the OT will invuln, before casting:

### Run: Dynamis (Sigma Version)

{: .note }
> MUR employs blasphemous strategies of using AMs (they're actually really nice for the last trio), that simplifies the **Hello World** section of Sigma. However, it's pretty straightforward without them.

At the beginning of Sigma, each player will be assigned 1 of 4 symbols and be inflicted with **Mid Glitch** or **Remote Glitch**, identical to **Party Synergy**. Two players will also be assigned a **Hello, Distant World** and **Hello, Near World** debuff. Two **Arms** will then spawn eitherside of a random cardinal/intercardinal and attach tethers to the two **furthest players** away from them. Directly opposite this is where **Omega-F** will spawn, where the party will move to line up as seen in the MUR cheatsheet.

Players will then be assigned targeting markers on their head for a line AOE, such that **2 pairs will have 2 markers**, and **2 pairs will have 1 marker**. The 2 players with **no marker**, must be on the **Omega-F relative** North-East and North-West to bait two line AOEs from the Arms.

Players will move to their designated positions, stepping in front of their waymarker for **Mid Glitch**, and moving to the wall for **Remote Glitch**.

As MUR is using the **Waymark strat**, players will remember the waymark they spread to as they come to the middle. **Omega-F** will then knock-back each player, where **Mid/Remote Glitch** will be resolved.  **(images)**

After the towers are soaked, **Final Omega's Blades** will spawn in the center with spinning arrows, and **Omega-F** will appear on a cardinal with either a staff or skates. Three players with 1 **Spark of Hope** stack are sent to the female, and the rest stack on the opposite side of the arena. If **Omega-F** has a **staff**, the players must wait against the edge of the AOE once it starts moving to avoid her cleave. If **Omega-F** has skates, simply chase the AOE after it begins moving.

Players will then move into their **Hello World** positions as seen below:

{: .note }
> If solved correctly, 4 players will have 1 stack of **Spark of Hope**, and 4 players will have 2 stacks of **Spark of Hope**.
