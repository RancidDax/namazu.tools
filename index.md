# Welcome to Namazu.tools

Namazu Tools is a resources website provided by **The Seat of Namazu** FF14 community, we are a collection of enthusiastic FF14 raiders who get together to take on Ultimates and Savage content. 

This site was put together to help combine various resources and guides into one comprehensive resource, our strategies are a collaboration of guides and tools from various other FF14 communities, with credits included on the pages and at the bottom of this page also.

Please note throughout this website you will see various labels used to identify which type of strategy or where it originates from. As this site originates from the **Materia** community, we typically use what is referred to as **MUR Strats** *(Materia Ultimate Raiding)* or **PF Strats** *(Party Finder)* so you will often see this label to indicate this around the website.

MUR Strats

PF Strats
