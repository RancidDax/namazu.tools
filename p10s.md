## Key Mechanics

### Dividing Wing
Two players will be marked with Tethers, these are baited wide cleaves, direct these SE and SW from respective wings.

One support and One DPS will be marked with large AOE, take each north, Support Left, DPS Right. Remaining players forms a triangle with them in the AOE. 

After tethers resolve, each tether player moves directly north to run through the webs connecting the other players to free them.

{: .note }
It is important to make sure the two circle AOEs are not touching otherwise the tethers will be unbreakable.

### Pandaemon's Holy or Circles of Pandaemonium
Boss will use one of two mechanics:

- Circles of Pandaemonium (move IN near boss)
-

- Pandaemon's Holy (move OUT away from boss)
-

### Wicked Step
Two tank-buster towers will appear, launching the tanks to opposing corners. 

Stand where the boss target circle intersects the red AOE arrows of the tower to land it correctly.

After this, the boss will use Entangling Web, One Healer and One DPS along with both tanks will get an AOE, the goal is to build a bridge by touching the AOE with each tank. 

- DPS match with the RIGHT tank.
- Healer match with the LEFT tank.

Once the AOEs execute, two bridges will appear and the tanks can return to the middle platform.

### Pandaemoniac Pillars
Eight pillars will spawn, these must be soaked by a player each, use the macro for positions:

```
■【Pandemoniac Pillars】
　　MT  H1  ST
　　D1  H2  D2　　※ Circles In
　　D3      D4　　※ Holy Out
```

Pillars are followed by a **Holy** or **Circle** (In/Out Mechanic) and each tower will become either a dynamo or chariot AOE.

After the towers are soaked, look for **Holy** or **Circle** and then look at the creatures that spawn above each tower.

**Jellyfish** = Dynamo (Donut AOE)

**Spikey Thing** = Chariot (Normal AOE)

Each row will have 2 and 1 of each, for example, two dynamo and one chariot.

The following are some examples of possible patterns:
